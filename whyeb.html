  			<h3 style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 50px">Private Space.</h3>
  			<p style="line-height: 1.6;font-size: 1.5em">Conventionally, to participate in events hosted by two distinct institutes, one has to create two unique accounts which are tedious and cumbersome. We want to efficiently facilitate this by restricting each user to a single login alone. The user needs to possess only one account to participate in any event regardless of its venue. Each university/college has its own private space dedicated to its students. So, information security won't be a prevailing issue and it won’t be compromised. </p>
